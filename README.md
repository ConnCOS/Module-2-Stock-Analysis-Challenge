# Module-2-Stock-Analysis-Challenge
This callenge calls for using VBA scripting to extract data from stock market activity of selected stocks for the years 2018-2020.
Using a script to loop through all stocks for one year, new columns are created to show the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price to closing price at the end of the year, and total stock volume of the stock.
Use conditional formatting to denote positve change in stock value in green and negative growth in red.
Once these values are determined, calculate and create outputs in new columns for greatest percent increase, greatest decrease and greatest total volume of stocks.
Ensure that the VBA script is enabled to run on every worksheet for all years.
This code was developed with significant code input from classmate Adam Gostinger and assistance from TA Carlos Fernandez. Other resources: VBA data types   https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-data-type/#Types, AskBCS learning assistant Angel Milla on rounding value for Q2 (ASK-262470).
